# Appviewer

We have problems with the implementation of the https://github.com/theNBS/ng2-adsk-forge-viewer library, syntax errors can be observed, we want to be able to visualize a 3d model in a web application in angular through the api of autodesk forge.

We try to be guided by this example https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-forge-viewer
